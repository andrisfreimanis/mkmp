# MKMP - My K-Means Program

## Motivation
I wanted to learn more about C++ and programming in general, so decided to write a simple k-means program. I imagine a program of such a small size could be way more simple, but this is a learning experience, so I'm overcomplicating things a bit.

## Requirements
1. Use OOP design
2. C++20
3. Use several folders
4. Automate testing
5. Automate building documentation e.g. Dokygen
6. Use some build system e.g. CMake
7. Use static code analyzer
