# MKMP - My K-Means Program

## Motivation
This is a learning exercise. I wanted to learn more about C++ and programming in general, so decided to write a simple k-means program. I imagine a program of such a small size could be way more simple, but this is a learning experience, so I'm overcomplicating things a bit.

## Requirements
1. C++20
2. Use several folders
3. Automate testing
4. Automate building documentation e.g. Dokygen
5. Use some build system e.g. CMake
6. Use static code analyzer
